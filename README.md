# AzurePowerShellSampleDeployment

## Summary

PowerShell sample script that deploys a complete environment on Azure that is comprised of two different locations connected by a vnet-to-vnet VPN, one in west and the other in east, on west we setup a virtual machine to act as a domain controller configured via Powershell DSC. On east location we setup two load balanced IIS servers with Powershell DSC as well to setup IIS role. East virtual machines are domain joined to show the communication between two virtual networks working through the VPN and using Network Security Groups to protect both subnets within the virtual networks. IIS servers are exposed to the internet through a public ip address attached to the load balancer.

This sample script is part of a Microsoft Service called Fast Start for IaaS that is delivered by PFEs and Consultants.
